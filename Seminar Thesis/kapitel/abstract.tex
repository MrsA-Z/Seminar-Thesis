\chapter{Abstract}

%TODO - write abstract & send to Atkinson
% short motivation of research context
Sustainability - important topic in many aspects globally, many industries, etc. - what is it? and which dimensions?\\
In ICT - also, most focus on Green IT / Hardware -> focus mainly on ecological sustainability, reduce energy consumption of HW

BUT: Also important / having an impact and even able to improve sustainability: Software - influence how hw is used, and in its development process & other lifecycle phases has influences (refer to impacts?)

--> Thus: field of Sustainable Software Engineering growing and important! deals with the question how to develop sustainable software products - this covers all lifecycle phases from design, actual implementation, but also usage, etc. 

many principles, guidelines, ways how to measure exist -> existence of models / frameworks for sustainable software engineering from a process view

(challenge: (to be verified?!) concrete metrics how to measure impacts of software - and how / when they can be used in (some model / concrete greensoft?) - in general?

% description of work done / TBD
With Secomo (?), a cost-estimating method based on green sw specifications, such metrics can be expressed and derived in sw engineering processes in a methodic way.

Purpose of this seminar paper --> analyze how secome can enhance / can contribute to sustainable sw engineering - how to use it / integrate it in this context.
