There is a dearth of models that define how a software can be developed and maintained in an environment friendly way. This paper discusses the changes in the existing SDLC and suggests appropriate steps which can lead to lower carbon emissions, power and paper use, thus helping organizations to move towards greener and sustainable software development.},

	abstract = {Many software systems today control large-scale sociotechnical systems. These systems aren't just entangled with the environment but also with our dwindling resources and mostly unsustainable way of living, while the planet's population continues to grow. Dealing with sustainability requirements and systematically supporting their elicitation, analysis, and realization is a problem that has yet to be solved. Decades ago, the discipline of software engineering dealt with similar shortcomings in its processes by including safety and security as new system qualities. In light of the increasing consequences of inadequately addressing sustainability in developing software systems, software engineers must apply the lessons learned from these prior research efforts and identify the necessary research agenda. Considering sustainability in software engineering means more than energy efficiency and green IT, which are concerned with the first-order impacts of software systems. Software engineers must also take into account the second- and third-order impacts in the system context, even if they're hard to assess. By doing so, engineers have the potential to considerably improve civilization's sustainability. The Web extra at http://youtu.be/VC07j6a1XUw is a video in which author Birgit Penzenstadler talks about how software engineers can considerably improve civilization's sustainability by taking into account not just the first-order impacts of software systems but also their second- and third-order impacts.},

Examples include e-waste from computers made obsolete due to software upgrades, and changes in the power demands of new versions of software. Sustainable software engineering aims to create reliable, long-lasting software that meets the needs of users while reducing environmental impacts. We conducted three related research efforts to explore this area. First, we investigated the extent to which users thought about the environmental impact of their software usage. Second, we created a tool called GreenTracker, which measures the energy consumption of software in order to raise awareness about the environmental impact of software usage. Finally, we explored the indirect environmental effects of software in order to understand how software affects sustainability beyond its own power consumption. The relationship between environmental sustainability and software engineering is complex; understanding both direct and indirect effects is critical to helping humans live more sustainably.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel energy-aware and temperature-aware programming model with first-class support for  sustainability.  A program written in the new language, named Eco, may adaptively adjusts its own behaviors to stay on a given (energy or temperature) budget, avoiding both deficit that would lead to battery drain or CPU overheating, and surplus that could have been used to improve the quality of results. Sustainability management in Eco is captured as a form of supply and demand matching, and the language runtime consistently maintains the equilibrium between supply and demand. Among the efforts of energy-adaptive and temperature-adaptive systems, Eco is distinctive in its role in bridging the programmer and the underlying system, and in particular, bringing both programmer knowledge and application-specific traits into energy optimization. Through a number of intuitive programming abstractions, Eco reduces challenging issues in this domain --- such as workload characterization and decision making in adaptation --- to simple programming tasks, ultimately offering fine-grained, programmable, and declarative sustainability to energy-efficient computing. Eco is an minimal extension to Java, and has been implemented as an open-source compiler. We validate the usefulness of Eco by upgrading real-world Java applications with energy awareness and temperature awareness.},

To date, it is not clear, whether the resource and energy savings through ICT overbalance the resource and energy consumption by ICT, or not. Up to now, manifold efforts of Green IT address the environmental aspects of sustainability considering computer hardware. However, there is still a lack of models, descriptions or realizations in the area of computer software and software process models. In our contribution, we first propose definitions of the terms “Green and Sustainable Software” and “Green and Sustainable Software Engineering”, then we outline a conceptual reference model, the GREENSOFT Model. This model includes a cradle-to-grave product life cycle model for software products, sustainability metrics and criteria for software, software engineering extensions for sustainably sound software design and development, as well as appropriate guidance.},

Consequently, Software Engineering for Sustainability (SE4S) has developed as an active area of research. Objective/Aim: Though SE4S gained much attention over the past few years and has resulted in a number of contributions, there is only one rigorous survey of the field. We follow up on this systematic mapping study from 2012 with a more in-depth overview of the status of research, as most work has been conducted in the last 4 years. Method: The applied method is a systematic mapping study through which we investigate which contributions were made, which knowledge areas are most explored, and which research type facets have been used, to distill a common understanding of the state-of-the-art in SE4S. Results: We contribute an overview of current research topics and trends, and their distribution according to the research type facet and the application domains. Furthermore, we aggregate the topics into clusters and list proposed and used methods, frameworks, and tools. Conclusion: The research map shows that impact currently is limited to few knowledge areas and there is need for a future roadmap to fill the gaps.},

	abstract = {Contrary to the common assumption that software is "environmentally friendly" simply because it is virtual, the processes and methods used to develop, maintain and deploy software do have an environmental and social impact that is normally not accounted for by software development practices. For example, e-waste could be greatly minimized if software vendors would take into consideration the lifetime of old hardware. Like so, software that is dependable minimizes waste of resources used to support the system. This paper introduces a set of software engineering metrics that can be used to assess the economic, social and environmental sustainability of software projects, and it demonstrates how these metrics were used to assess a real project.},

	doi = {10.1109/GREENS.2012.6224251},
	abstract = {GreenIT has emerged as a discipline concerned with the optimization of software solutions with regards to their energy consumption. In this domain, most of state-of-the-art solutions offer limited or constraining approaches to monitor the energy consumption of a device or a process. In this paper, we therefore report on a runtime energy monitoring framework we developed to easily report on the energy consumption of system processes. Concretely, our approach adopts an OS-level library, called PowerAPI, which estimates the power consumption of processes according to different dimensions (CPU, network, etc.). In order to better understand potential energy leaks of legacy software, we use this library to study the impact of programming languages and algorithmic choices on the energy consumption. This preliminary study is based on an empirical evaluation of a eight implementations of the Towers of Hanoi problem.},

	abstract = {ICT significantly contributes to the global carbon dioxide production. In the last years the research addressed the problem of increasing ICT sustainability from different perspectives. In this paper this problem is addressed from a software process perspective. Sustainability of software process is approached in a systematic way by defining a core set of processes that represent the activities to be performed in order to introduce and integrate the greenness culture in an organization developing software. The processes have been defined so that they can be measured in terms of process capability according to the ISO/IEC 15504 standard. The relationships between process capability and sustainability are discussed as well.},
